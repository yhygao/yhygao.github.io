## Graphics Systems and Models

**Computer graphics** is concerned with all aspects of producing pictures or images using a computer. At the very first, we can only draw some lines and figures in the monitor; now, we can generate images by computer that are indistinguisable from the real images.

#### Application of computer Graphics

1. **Display of information**
   a) CG as a medium to convey information among people as visual system is unrivaled for human to receive information.
   b) Visualization of data for better understanding of complex phenomena, like bioinformatics data, fluid flow, molecular biology, and methematics.
   c)  Visualization of medical images (three-dimentional data).
   
2. **Design**
    a) Engineering and architecture need to iteratively design, test, and refine their models to meet the a set of specifications. e.g. computer-aided design (CAD), very-large-scale integrated circuits (VLSI).
3. **Simulation and animation**
    a) As CG is capable of generating sophisticated images in real time, it can be used as simulators to train pilots, drivers or even self-driving models.
    b) CG can also be used for animation in the television, motion picture, and advertising industries to create artistic effects or reduce the cost.
    c) Virtual reality (VR) is a rising field of CG to create stereoscopic vision.
4. **User interfaces**
    a) The interaction with computers is dominated by CG, which is a visual paradigm that includes windows, icons, menus, and a pointing devices.
